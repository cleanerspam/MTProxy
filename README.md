**Unblock Telegram** instantly with this ultra-lightweight, multi-architecture MTProto Proxy. Designed for **privacy**, **security**, and bypassing **censorship (DPI)** with FakeTLS.

🚀 **Fix Telegram Lag & Throttling**: Perfect for regions where Telegram is slowed down. experience **instant message sending** and **fast video downloads** without buffering.

Ideal for **Raspberry Pi**, low-end VPS, and any server with limited resources.

### 🏆 Why use this over the official image?
The official `telegrammessenger/proxy` Docker image hasn't been updated since **2018**. It is outdated, heavy, and lacks support for modern ARM secure protocols.

**This image is superior because:**
- **🚀 Modern & Maintained**: Built on the latest, actively maintained Go library.
- **🛡️ Secure**: Supports modern FakeTLS and anti-replay protections that didn't exist in 2018.
- **📉 95% Smaller**: The official image is ~200MB+. This image is **~10MB**.
- **🌐 Universal**: Runs natively on ARM64 (Raspberry Pi/Ampere), AMD64, and more.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🌐 Multi-Architecture Support**: Runs on everything!
    - **Platforms**: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/arm/v7`, `linux/riscv64`, `linux/s390x`, `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/386`.
    - Perfect for cheap ARM servers, Raspberry Pis, and old hardware.
- **⚡ High Speed & Anti-Throttling**: Overcome ISP throttling. Watch videos and download files at full speed, even if your encrypted traffic is usually slowed down.
- **⚡ Ultra Lightweight**: Based on **Alpine Linux**. The compressed image is **only ~10-15MB**!
- **🔒 FakeTLS**: Disguises your traffic as standard HTTPS (default: `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`) to bypass Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and firewalls in restrictive regions.
- **🛡️ Anti-Replay**: Prevents active probing attacks. The proxy cannot be detected or blocked by replaying captured packets.
- **👁️ Privacy First**: This project is built with good intentions. It **completely ignores** user data. It effectively acts as a blind tunnel—it does not (and cannot) eavesdrop, store, or inspect your private Telegram messages.
- **🔑 Secure**: Automatically generates strong, random secrets if none are provided.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get your proxy running in seconds. A secret will be auto-generated for you.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name mtproxy \
  --restart always \
  -p 8443:8888 \
  arm64builds/mtproxy:latest
```

**View your connection links:**
```bash
docker logs mtproxy
```

## 🐳 Docker Compose

For the best experience, use Docker Compose. This method ensures your configuration is clean and reproducible.

### 1. 📥 Download & Setup
Create a directory to keep things organized:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/mtproxy && cd ~/mtproxy
```

Download the officially recommended compose file and set your desired port (e.g., `443` for maximum stealth):

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleanerspam/MTProxy/main/docker-compose.yml
echo "HOST_PORT=443" > .env
```

### 2. ▶️ Start the Proxy

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
*Your proxy is now running on port 443! The secret is auto-generated and saved.*

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize the proxy using environment variables in your `.env` file or `docker run` command.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SECRET` | A 32-character hex secret. If not provided, one is generated automatically. | *(Randomly Generated)* |
| `DOMAIN` | The FakeTLS domain to disguise traffic as. | `cdnjs.cloudflare.com` |
| `HOST_PORT`| The public port on your server. Important for generating correct links. | `8443` |
| `PUBLIC_IP`| Your server's public IP address. | *(Auto-detected via ifconfig.me)* |

---

## 💾 Persistence

The container is stateless by default, but it can persist your generated secret so it doesn't change on restarts.

To enable this, simply mount a file to `/data/.env`. The container will save the generated secret there.

```bash
touch .env
docker run -d \
  -p 8443:8888 \
  -v $(pwd)/.env:/data/.env \
  arm64builds/mtproxy:latest
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### 🔍 Check Logs
If you can't connect, check the logs first. It will show you the generated secret and connection links (tg:// and https://).
```bash
docker logs mtproxy
```

### 🚪 Firewall & Security Groups
The most common issue is a blocked port. Ensure traffic is allowed on your chosen port (e.g., `443` or `8443`).

**VPS Firewalls:**
- **Ubuntu/Debian (ufw):** `sudo ufw allow 443/tcp`
- **CentOS/RHEL (iptables):** `sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT`

**Cloud Provider Security Groups:**
If you use **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, **Oracle Cloud**, or **Alibaba Cloud**, you **MUST** go to your cloud console and add an "Ingress Rule" (Inbound Rule) to allow TCP traffic on your port (0.0.0.0/0).
